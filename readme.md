## Usage

`Usage: qbtbar <mode> <directory>`

`<mode>:`

`-b	Create a backup.`

`-r	Restore a backup.`

`<directory>	For backup mode, this specifies the parent directory to generate the backup into (the backup directory name itself is auto-generated). For restore mode this specifies a backup directory previously generated by backup mode.`

---------------------------------------

Execute `./program <mode> <directory` found in the portable release using a Terminal application. Alternatively if you have install the `.deb` package file `qbtbar` will be available as a global user command to the system, so just `qbtbar <mode> <directory` works fine.

Notes:

* If you use external drives to store any torrents, please make sure they have the same mount point as when the backup was originally taken. 
* It is always best practice to make sure any external drives containing torrents are mounted in the OS before starting qBittorrent.
